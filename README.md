Simple code for blackjack game

Hi there! This is my first time using Github as well as my first project.
Feel free to help me a better coder.
Thanks!

Need to work on:

- Decks instead of random cards
- Strategy used in blackjack game
  - Offering Insurance if dealer showing A
  - Double
  - Splitting

Finished:

- random draw
- convert J, Q, K, A to integer
- A's as 1 and 11
- dealer should hit until 17
- Player busted > 21
- Dealer busted > 21
- Determining who won
- Scoring
- Adding bet
- Moving the game into function so can be played multiple times
- Adding blackjack to both (dealer if show high card)
