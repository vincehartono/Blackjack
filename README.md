Simple code for blackjack game

Hi there! This is my first time using Github as well as my first project.
Feel free to help me a better coder.
Thanks!

Need to work on:

- function to define "A" as 1 or 11
- Dealer busted
- Comparing player vs dealer
- Strategy used in blackjack game

Finished:

- random draw
- convert J, Q, K, A to integer
- dealer should hit until 17
- Player busted > 21
